<div class="container">

    <div class="section">
        <p>In case you wish to have amazing food at a wonderful sports bar, Walk-On’s Sports Bistreaux is the right place for you. With its Louisiana roots, the menu is packed with bold flavors, Southern comfort food, and a little something for everyone. Walk-On’s has plenty to offer for anyone in the mood for a succulent burger, delightful seafood, or a shareable appetizer.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Begin with Appetizers</h2>
        <p>Walk-On's knows how to start things right, and with their starters, they set the tone for the meal to come. One of their popular appetizers is the Boom Boom Shrimp: crispy shrimp drizzled with a fiery creamy sauce, guaranteed to bring you back for more. Then comes the Boudin Balls, a Louisiana “must” made-of Cajun-seasoned rice and pork which is then deep-fried to perfection. If you are leaning toward cheesy goodness, look no further than Cajun Queso with seasoned beef and served with tortilla chips. And for those who are fans of sweet and savory mix, you can’t go wrong with Devils on Horseback which are bacon-wrapped shrimp.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Burgers and Sandwiches</h2>
        <p>A good burger is hard to resist, and Walk-On’s does theirs right. The Hickory Burger is a smoky delight, and a BBQ lover’s fantasy with cheddar cheese, bacon, and hickory sauce as toppings. If you are extra hungry, the stack of bacon, American cheese, and a fried egg on the Hangover Burger will sure do the trick. Sandwich enthusiasts are not left out either, with options like the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich that comes with spicy buffalo sauce and ranch to mellow things out. If grilled cheese is more your thing, the Grown-Up Grilled Cheese will change your perspective on this childhood classic. It includes three cheeses and crispy bacon.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Cajun Seafood and Pasta</h2>
        <p>Walk-On’s is originally from Louisiana, so their seafood dishes are always on point. The Bayou Pasta, with its blackened shrimp over linguine, tossed in creamy crawfish sauce, makes sure not too disappoint. There’s also the Cajun Ribeye, which is a tender juicy steak with a spice rub served with mashed potatoes and veggies. My personal favorite and a must try is the Crawfish Étouffée. You can't get more Louisiana than this dish, it's rich, savory, and served over rice in true Southern style.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Lighter Fare: Salads & Wraps</h2>
        <p>Walk-On's does not disappoint if you wish to make a healthier choice. Their Ahi Tuna Salad comes with seared tuna with a fresh bed of greens with an Asian inspired dressing which is light and refreshing. The Cypress Cobb Salad is also nutritious and quite filling. It comes with grilled chicken, avocado, bacon, eggs and bleu cheese. If your taste leans towards wraps, then the Buffalo Chicken Wrap will do the trick. It features crispy chicken wrapped in a soft tortilla along with ranch, lettuce and tomato.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Tacos, Sides & Sweet Endings</h2>
        <p>Walk-On’s tacos offer bold new flavors that are sure to stir excitement, like the Gator Tacos with blackened alligator, slaw, and a zesty sauce. Another top pick that is also quite popular are the Boom Boom Shrimp Tacos. They come with crispy shrimp and are finished with the signature Boom Boom sauce. You can also add some sides to any meal including Red Beans & Rice, Mac & Cheese, or Sweet Potato Fries which makes it taste like authentic Southern food.</p>
        <p>In conclusion, no dessert lover should miss out on the warm and gooey Krispy Kreme Bread Pudding made out of real Krispy Kreme donuts. It is the best way to cap off a meal at Walk-On’s, which every mouthful encapsulates Louisiana in an enjoyable ambiance.</p>
